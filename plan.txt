collisions:
    find objects that may be colliding using AABBs
    check if casting a ray from the point in a polygon has even/odd # intersections with faces of the other.
    if even we're outside.
        done
    if odd we're inside:
        find the fastest way to get out of the shape
        let's say our point is p
        for each face:
            get vectors v1 v2 v3 to each triangle vertex
            get vector v4 in direction of the normal. (throw it out if p + v4 is outside the triangle)
            find the vector v with the least magnitude 
        .5 * force the point toward v
        .5 * force the thing at v toward the point
        // if it's a face we lerp the force across its 3 verts
        done
